# Port-of-Rotterdam
A small simulation of the containers in the port. 

In this exercise you simulate the unloading of a container ship. This task is mainly designed to teach you the use of inheritance, polymorphism and threading. Use inheritance and polymorphism helps you program more efficiently, making it easier later it's time to expand your program (this is often the case with projects).Problems encountered by computer programs when using multithreading
want the same data. Such questions are included in this assignment. It is our responsibility to find the right solution for this.


THE MODEL:

- Een containerschip is aangekomen in de Rotterdamse haven en ligt aan de kade.

- Containers are removed from the ship using two cranes.
